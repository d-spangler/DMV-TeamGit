        <h2>Div Two</h2>
        <p>You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, 
        you only have to look to see it. And just raise cain. We can fix anything.We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. 
        Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Work that paint. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone.
         These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. We can always carry this a step further.
         There's really no end to this. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations.

        <p>This is Michael's profile, he has a picture of a hotdog and some text.</p>
        <p>Under that text he has some more text.  Is the easter egg hidden here or somewhere else?</p>
